## What did I use?

Tools:
- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Git (obviously)
- Node.js

## What is it for?

I started the project for my [secondary school](https://www.laveg.edu.ee/et) practical work at 11th grade. Also I wanted to learn some web-development. Here I'm just gonna name skills I've learnt during the project.

Skills:
- html syntax
- Tailwind CSS styles
- Git (Still need to improve)
- Full-stack webapp creation
- JavaScript (Beginner's level)
- Routing at web
- Web development in general

Thanks to my brother (Aleksandr Razdolski) for heading me and thanks to my Estonian language teacher (Maria Roganova) that aproached with the project idea.

I learned much and I would like to try something like this in future. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¤™
